any alterations published into yt or scratch will have a copyright claim (whitout permission)

you can make changes but keep them without publishing them
-------------------
my scratch game is liscenced with Â©copyright with permission all the assests that you see on the svratch project are under free use

if you want to make a video showcasing it give credit 

and you will say if i don't want any changes why do i put it for download... because i have scratch for desktop and i cant publish the project and i dont want to create a web scratch account for some reasons
so you will need to download it and then upload it to yt or whatever with credits
